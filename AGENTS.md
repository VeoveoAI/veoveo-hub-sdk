# Agent Instructions

These rules apply to this repository and to component repositories created from it.

- Use upstream runtimes such as OpenShell and PostgreSQL unmodified. Adapt through
  supported configuration.
- Prefer strong types: typed structs, enums and domain identifiers over raw strings and
  JSON wherever the shape is known.
- The server owns one PostgreSQL schema named after its slug and applies the crate's
  `migrations/` there at startup. Never edit an applied migration; add a new one.
- Every SQL statement is a `.sql` file beside the code that runs it, run through sqlx's
  checked `query_file*!` macros. Builds read the committed `.sqlx` metadata, because
  `.cargo/config.toml` sets `SQLX_OFFLINE`. After changing a query or a migration,
  regenerate the metadata from an empty target directory.
- Statements and tables follow the server schema rules of veoveo-core's
  [database design](https://github.com/VeoveoAI/veoveo-core/blob/435fc1a90d5761f6dca2af05f4cadde324b72428/docs/DATABASE.md),
  which `tests/database_conformance.rs` checks. A statement binds its tenant, bounds its
  rows and reaches them through an index in a generic plan. A table has a primary key,
  an index whose leading columns are each foreign key's, and a
  `COMMENT ON TABLE … IS 'Retention: …'`. A statement that cannot comply carries a
  `-- veoveo:` marker that states its reason.
- Page a listing with core's `PageSize` and a `KeysetCursor` from a `CursorScope`
  bound to the listing and the tenant, with one statement for the first page and one
  for the pages after a cursor. Do not write a `$cursor IS NULL OR …` predicate, which
  loses the index seek in a cached generic plan.
- Keep test logic in Rust and tool behavior in each tool's own configuration. Do not add
  a task runner or shell scripts that hold test logic.
- Pin exact versions and image digests. When changing a pin, verify the latest stable
  release at its source.
- Run `docker build --target check .` on macOS and on Linux before pushing.
- Names, identifiers and formats follow the
  [naming and format conventions](https://github.com/VeoveoAI/veoveo-core/blob/main/docs/CONVENTIONS.md).
  Where a standard governs a name or format, follow it; extend a standard only through
  its own extension mechanism. URIs, paths and identifiers carry no version segment such
  as `/v1`; releases carry versions.
- Commit small, coherent changes. Commits carry no AI or tool attribution.
